<h2><i>Context</i></h2>
<p>Every conscience has its own experience of the present. What defines it? Is it in contrast to the previous decade? Is it a reflection in the aftermath of a pandemic? Or is it just human, conscious evolution? In this new technological environment we face a new and distinct era of art, the rise of the internet has given artists the tools for more creative ways to bring their vision to life. 

  Taking inspiration from Aby Warburg’s Mnemosyne Atlas, a class of Art and Multimedia Communication from the Master in Multimedia at the University of Porto composed this deck of Tarot cards showing a glimpse of different views into contemporaneity.

  <h2><i>Purpose</i></h2>
<p>During the first semester of the Master in Multimedia at University of Porto, the students with the professor made visual representations of our vision of the present in contrast to the past. We described this exercise as a visual representation of the future, through the Tarot.
  This contextual thinking method can help to develop the ability to analyze and interpret socio-cultural changes and phenomena in various contexts. 
  Dealing with randomness and finding a meaning within it can provide an interesting thought experiment, which is why the form of a Tarot deck was chosen. No matter the card you pull, it’s always possible to relate it to yourself and the world around you.
  The creation of this project in itself also had a plethora of pedagogical purposes:
  <li>Providing intuitive readings of the present times</li>>
  <li>Inspiring multiple ways of perceiving current media, particularly in connection with past media and processes</li>  
  <li>Inspiring unorthodox processes of creativity using available digital tools</li> 
  <li>poetic elements within objective discourse</li>
